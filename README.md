# C4QWeatherApp

Currently has basic zip code search functions, in addition to minimum viable product of weekly forecast of highs and lows in both ℉ and ℃. Feel free to check out PostCommitFixes branch to see extra work to improve user QoL.

Future implementation: 
- NSUserDefaults to save last searched zip code
- Forecast at user location
- Debugging: Check to see whether the zip code is in correct format instead of using API call to determine if the search is successful.
